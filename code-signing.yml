# We should now be able to access the certificate using the standard Windows signtool.exe from the Windows SDK,
# which should be installed on the build agent images being used.

# Typically, you often see examples of signtool.exe and other things accessing the certificate by the thumbprint.
# And in fact, the sample SSL.com code includes a bunch of extra PowerShell script to get the thumbprint. But the
# signtool.exe can take a /n parameter to specify the name of the certificate. So we can use that instead. And
# hopefully that won't change when we renew the certificate.
